# SpeechWriting (Mundbildschrift)

Mundbildschrift is a phonetic notation system designed to assist in the articulation training of deaf children. 
It assigns specific symbols to different sounds of the German language. 
The system focuses less on spelling accuracy and more on the association of graphemes with sound patterns to 
facilitate the identification of specific mouth shapes. 
This also helps in developing specialized word lists for educational purposes.
